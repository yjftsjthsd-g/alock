# alock #

**alock** locks the X server until the user enters a password via the
keyboard. If the authentification was successful the X server is
unlocked and the user can continue to work.

**alock** does not provide any fancy animations like **xlock** or **xscreensaver**
and never will. Its just for locking the current X session.
